(A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.
(B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor to the software ends automatically.

DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE OR DERIVATIVE WORKS.
9.      That we have no duty of reasonable care or lack of negligence, and we are not 
obligated to provide any technical support, updates or any other form of support 
for the Software, but if any support or updates are provided (which shall be solely 
in our discretion), they shall be deemed part of the Software and governed by this 
Agreement.  The provision of any Software technical support, updates or other
